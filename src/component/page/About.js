            To do list application is a list of tasks you need to complete or
            things that you want to do. Most typically, they’re organised in
            order of priority. Traditionally, they’re written on a piece of
            paper or post it notes and act as a memory aid. As technology has
            evolved we have been able to create a todo lists with excel
            spreadsheets, word documents, email lists, todo list apps, Microsoft
            to do and google to do list to name a few. You can use a to do list
            in your home and personal life, or in the workplace. Having a list
            of everything you need to do written down in one place means you
            shouldn’t forget anything important. By prioritising the tasks in
            the list you plan the order in which you’re going to do them and can
            quickly see what needs your immediate attention and what tasks you
            can leave until a little later.
